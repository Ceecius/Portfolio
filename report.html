            <p>For this module I have been tasked with creating a responsive website using html and css. Prior to starting this module, I had no experience with either language so the thought of creating an entire website felt daunting. However, as the weeks progressed, I began learning more about html and in turn I became more confident during the website-making process. The most enjoyable part of this module was using css to improve the look of the webpages as well as creating keyframes to add animations. However, it didn’t always go smoothly as there were many times when I would become frustrated trying to figure out why an animation wasn’t working or why certain properties would conflict with others. Despite the frustration, the satisfaction of getting things to work kept me going.  

            When designing my website, I went for a minimal style so that it can be used easily by any user. As for the colour scheme, I stuck to small selection of blues for buttons, boxes, footers, etc., I decided to have a white background so that any text could be easy to read. As for the technical aspects, I used grid template areas to organise various sections of the page with ease. I added animations to the navigation buttons when a cursor hovers over them to make the website feel more responsive. I achieved this by using hover and after selectors to target the buttons. I made both a desktop and mobile version so that the website is functional on multiple devices. For the mobile version, the navigation bar is hidden until the burger icon is pressed unlike the desktop version which has a horizontal that can always be seen.  I used 3 separate css sheets for this, one sheet was dedicated to mobile-only features, another to desktop-only features, and the last sheet was dedicated to features shared by both such as font and colours.
            I gained inspiration for my website from gitbhub:
